This can be used to find the user ID when we know an fb app ID.

How to use it - 

1) Install **node** and **npm** if they are not already installed.

2) `npm install` to install the **npm** packages.

3) `node server.js` to run the application(or `nodemon server.js` if you have **nodemon** installed).

Browse **localhost:8080/api/ID** where **ID** is the **fb app ID**. It will return the **user ID**.
