This can be used to find the user ID when we know an fb app ID.

How to use it - 

1) `npm install` to install the npm packages.

2) `node server.js` to run the application(or `nodemon server.js` if you have nodemon installed).

Browse `localhost:8080/api/ID` where ID is the fb app ID. It will return the user ID.
